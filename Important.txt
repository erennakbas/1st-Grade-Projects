-First you should examine the assignment instructions from the pdfs I uploaded. So that you can understand what is it for and how it's run. 
This is important for you to get the idea of the projects.

Every assignment is tested on our department's
dev server. Each one of it works fine, I got full credit from both
of my laboratory courses (BBM103-BBM104).

-I started coding with these assignments so it may contain 
unnecessary code parts, bugs etc. .
